comment|/*  * File write-locks as used by Git.  *  * The lockfile API serves two purposes:  *  * * Mutual exclusion and atomic file updates. When we want to change  *   a file, we create a lockfile `<filename>.lock`, write the new  *   file contents into it, and then rename the lockfile to its final  *   destination `<filename>`. We create the `<filename>.lock` file  *   with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` so that we can notice and fail if somebody  *   else has already locked the file, then atomically rename the  *   lockfile to its final destination to commit the changes and  *   unlock the file.  *  * * Automatic cruft removal. If the program exits after we lock a  *   file but before the changes have been committed, we want to make  *   sure that we remove the lockfile. This is done by remembering the  *   lockfiles we have created in a linked list and setting up an  *   `atexit(3)` handler and a signal handler that clean up the  *   lockfiles. This mechanism ensures that outstanding lockfiles are  *   cleaned up if the program exits (including when `die()` is  *   called) or if the program is terminated by a signal.  *  * Please note that lockfiles only block other writers. Readers do not  * block, but they are guaranteed to see either the old contents of  * the file or the new contents of the file (assuming that the  * filesystem implements `rename(2)` atomically).  *  *  * Calling sequence  * ----------------  *  * The caller:  *  * * Allocates a `struct lock_file` either as a static variable or on  *   the heap, initialized to zeros. Once you use the structure to  *   call the `hold_lock_file_for_*()` family of functions, it belongs  *   to the lockfile subsystem and its storage must remain valid  *   throughout the life of the program (i.e. you cannot use an  *   on-stack variable to hold this structure).  *  * * Attempts to create a lockfile by calling  *   `hold_lock_file_for_update()` or `hold_lock_file_for_append()`.  *  * * Writes new content for the destination file by either:  *  *   * writing to the file descriptor returned by the  *     `hold_lock_file_for_*()` functions (also available via  *     `lock->fd`).  *  *   * calling `fdopen_lock_file()` to get a `FILE` pointer for the  *     open file and writing to the file using stdio.  *  * When finished writing, the caller can:  *  * * Close the file descriptor and rename the lockfile to its final  *   destination by calling `commit_lock_file()` or  *   `commit_lock_file_to()`.  *  * * Close the file descriptor and remove the lockfile by calling  *   `rollback_lock_file()`.  *  * * Close the file descriptor without removing or renaming the  *   lockfile by calling `close_lock_file()`, and later call  *   `commit_lock_file()`, `commit_lock_file_to()`,  *   `rollback_lock_file()`, or `reopen_lock_file()`.  *  * Even after the lockfile is committed or rolled back, the  * `lock_file` object must not be freed or altered by the caller.  * However, it may be reused; just pass it to another call of  * `hold_lock_file_for_update()` or `hold_lock_file_for_append()`.  *  * If the program exits before `commit_lock_file()`,  * `commit_lock_file_to()`, or `rollback_lock_file()` is called, an  * `atexit(3)` handler will close and remove the lockfile, thereby  * rolling back any uncommitted changes.  *  * If you need to close the file descriptor you obtained from a  * `hold_lock_file_for_*()` function yourself, do so by calling  * `close_lock_file()`. You should never call `close(2)` or  * `fclose(3)` yourself, otherwise the `struct lock_file` structure  * would still think that the file descriptor needs to be closed, and  * a commit or rollback would result in duplicate calls to `close(2)`.  * Worse yet, if you close and then later open another file descriptor  * for a completely different purpose, then a commit or rollback might  * close that unrelated file descriptor.  *  * Error handling  * --------------  *  * The `hold_lock_file_for_*()` functions return a file descriptor on  * success or -1 on failure (unless `LOCK_DIE_ON_ERROR` is used; see  * "flags" below). On errors, `errno` describes the reason for  * failure. Errors can be reported by passing `errno` to  * `unable_to_lock_message()` or `unable_to_lock_die()`.  *  * Similarly, `commit_lock_file`, `commit_lock_file_to`, and  * `close_lock_file` return 0 on success. On failure they set `errno`  * appropriately, do their best to roll back the lockfile, and return  * -1.  */
