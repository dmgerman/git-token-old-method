HOW TO INSTALL git-subtree
==========================

Copy the file 'git-subtree.sh' to /usr/local/bin/git-subtree.

That will make a 'git subtree' (note: space instead of dash) command
available.  See the file git-subtree.txt for more.

You can also install the man page by doing:

	make doc
	cp git-subtree.1 /usr/share/man/man1/
