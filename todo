	
	write proper docs (asciidoc format for git compatibility)

	delete tempdir

	'git subtree rejoin' option to do the same as --rejoin, eg. after a
	  rebase

	--prefix doesn't force the subtree correctly in merge/pull:
	"-s subtree" should be given an explicit subtree option?
		There doesn't seem to be a way to do this.  We'd have to
		patch git-merge-subtree.  Ugh.
		(but we could avoid this problem by generating squashes with
		exactly the right subtree structure, rather than using
		subtree merge...)

	add a 'push' subcommand to parallel 'pull'
	
	add a 'log' subcommand to see what's new in a subtree?

	add to-submodule and from-submodule commands

	automated tests for --squash stuff

	test.sh fails in msysgit?
		sort error - see Thell's email
