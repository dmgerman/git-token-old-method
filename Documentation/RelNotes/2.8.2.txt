Git v2.8.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.8.1
------------------

 * The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
   the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
   array of strings.

 * Bunch of tests on "git clone" has been renumbered for better
   organization.

 * The tests that involve running httpd leaked the system-wide
   configuration in /etc/gitconfig to the tested environment.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
