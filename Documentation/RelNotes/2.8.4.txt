Git v2.8.4 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.8.3
------------------

 * Documentation for "git merge --verify-signatures" has been updated
   to clarify that the signature of only the commit at the tip is
   verified.  Also the phrasing used for signature and key validity is
   adjusted to align with that used by OpenPGP.

 * On Windows, .git and optionally any files whose name starts with a
   dot are now marked as hidden, with a core.hideDotFiles knob to
   customize this behaviour.

 * Portability enhancement for "rebase -i" to help platforms whose
   shell does not like "for i in <empty>" (which is not POSIX-kosher).

 * "git fsck" learned to catch NUL byte in a commit object as
   potential error and warn.

 * CI test was taught to build documentation pages.

 * Many 'linkgit:<git documentation page>' references were broken,
   which are all fixed with this.

Also contains other minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
