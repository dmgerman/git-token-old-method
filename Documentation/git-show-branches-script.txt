git-show-branches-script(1)
===========================
v0.99.4, Aug 2005

NAME
----
git-show-branches-script - Show branches and their commits.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git show-branches <reference>...'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the head commits from the named <reference> (or all refs under
$GIT_DIR/refs/heads), and displays concise list of commit logs
to show their relationship semi-visually.

OPTIONS
-------
<reference>::
	Name of the reference under $GIT_DIR/refs/heads/.


OUTPUT
------
Given N <references>, the first N lines are the one-line
description from their commit message.  The branch head that is
pointed at by $GIT_DIR/HEAD is prefixed with an asterisk '*'
character while other heads are prefixed with a '!' character.

Following these N lines, one-line log for each commit is
displayed, indented N places.  If a commit is on the I-th
branch, the I-th indentation character shows a '+' sign;
otherwise it shows a space.

The following example shows three branches, "pu", "master" and
"rc":

------------------------------------------------
* [pu] Add cheap local clone '-s' flag to git-clone-script
 ! [master] Documentation updates.
  ! [rc] Merge master into rc
+   Add cheap local clone '-s' flag to git-clone-script
+   Alternate object pool mechanism updates.
+   Audit rev-parse users.
++  Documentation updates.
  + Merge master into rc
+++ [PATCH] plug memory leak in diff.c::diff_free_filepair()
------------------------------------------------

These three branches all forked from a common commit, "[PATCH]
plug memory leak...", and "rc" has one commit ahead of it.  The
"master" branch has one different commit that is also shared by
"pu" branch, and "pu" branch has three more commits on top of
"master" branch.
